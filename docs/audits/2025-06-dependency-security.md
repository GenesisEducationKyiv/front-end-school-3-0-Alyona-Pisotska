## 2. Security Verification and Vulnerability Assessment

### 2.1 Methodology

To ensure a thorough security assessment of all project dependencies, a multi-layered approach was used, combining static analysis tools, package reputation checks, and community signals.

The following tools and techniques were applied:

#### ✅ npm audit

The built-in `npm audit` command was used to scan the project's dependency tree against the GitHub Advisory Database. It identifies known vulnerabilities and suggests safe upgrades.

##### 🔍 Detected Vulnerabilities via `npm audit`

During the audit, one **low-severity vulnerability** was identified using the built-in `npm audit` tool:

- **Package:** `brace-expansion`
- **Versions affected:** `1.0.0 – 1.1.11` and `2.0.0 – 2.0.1`
- **Vulnerability:** [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw)
- **Severity:** Low
- **Affected paths:** Transitive dependencies within ESLint-related packages (`eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-import`, etc.)
- **Impact:** Affects development-only tooling. Does **not** impact production code or runtime behavior.

##### 🔧 Resolution: The vulnerability was automatically remediated by running: `npm audit fix`.

#### ✅ Snyk.io

[Snyk](https://snyk.io) was used to perform an in-depth security analysis by cross-checking the project's dependencies against a continuously updated vulnerability database.
This tool provides contextual remediation guidance and monitors transitive dependencies.

Audit Results:

- ✅ Tested: 157 dependencies
- ❌ Vulnerabilities found: None
- 📄 Target file: package-lock.json
- 🛡️ Licenses monitoring: Enabled
- 🗂️ Open source project: No

##### 🔧 Conclusion: The audit confirmed that there are no known vulnerabilities in the direct or transitive dependencies of the music_app project at the time of testing.

#### ✅ Manual Package Review

Each package was reviewed for:

- Recent development activity (last commit, release frequency)
- Issue responsiveness and maintenance health
- Number of active maintainers
- Community trust (GitHub stars, forks, and ecosystem usage)

Additionally:

- All packages use permissive open-source licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
- No deprecated or archived packages were identified
- All dependencies are actively maintained

##### 🔧 Conclusion: These indicators help detect overengineered or risky packages that may introduce unnecessary security risks.

### 2.2 Audit Findings (as of June 13, 2025)

✅ **No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found**

The `npm audit` and Snyk scans returned zero critical or high-risk issues. Only one low-severity vulnerability (`brace-expansion` ReDoS) was found in a devDependency, which has no impact on production and can be auto-fixed.

✅ **All dependencies are actively maintained and widely adopted**

Each package was checked for recent GitHub activity (commits, releases) and issue responsiveness. Popular libraries like `react`, `react-hook-form`, and `@tanstack/react-query` are maintained by well-established teams and widely used in the frontend ecosystem.

✅ **No deprecated or unmaintained packages are used**

A manual review confirmed that none of the dependencies are deprecated, archived, or flagged as unmaintained. This will reduce the risk of unresolved vulnerabilities in the future.

### 2.3 Zero-Day Vulnerability Considerations

Zero-day vulnerabilities are previously unknown security flaws for which no official fixes or patches currently exist. By their very nature, they cannot be proactively detected using traditional static scanning tools like `npm audit` or Snyk, as these tools rely on databases of already identified vulnerabilities.
Nevertheless, we have implemented and continuously refined the following preventative measures to **minimize their potential impact**, particularly within the context of front-end development.

#### 🔐 Current Prevention Strategy

Our current strategy is built upon a multi-layered approach that reduces the likelihood of unknown vulnerabilities being exploited:

- ⚙️ **Using the latest stable versions** of all direct and transitive dependencies. This approach ensures we benefit from the most recent security patches and bug fixes for known vulnerabilities that may have been discovered from previous releases.
- 📦 **Minimizing third-party dependencies**. Each additional library or framework increases the project's attack surface. By reducing the number of external dependencies, we lower the risk of introducing hidden or malicious code that might contain zero-day vulnerabilities or provide vectors for their exploitation. This also simplifies code auditing.
- 🧪 **Encouraging manual reviews of unfamiliar or small-scale packages**. Special attention is given to packages with low visibility, few maintainers, or low download counts. For such dependencies, a thorough manual code audit is performed, along with a review of their reputation within the developer community. This helps identify potential threats that might be hidden within less scrutinized solutions.
- 🔑 **Applying secure development principles and validation**:

  - Thorough Input Validation: All input data must always be validated on both the client-side and server-side to prevent injections and other manipulations.
  - Output Escaping and Sanitization: Any data displayed on the page must be properly escaped and sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious HTML or JavaScript.
  - DOM Isolation: Utilizing modern front-end frameworks that isolate DOM access can reduce the risk of page element manipulations.-

#### 🧩 Additional Recommendations for Enhanced Security

- 🚨 **Establishing an Incident Response Plan**. For zero-day events, a well-defined IRP is crucial. This includes clear procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and post-incident analyzing security breaches. While prevention is key, readiness to respond swiftly to the unknown is paramount.
- 🔔 **Enabling automated security monitoring tools**. Actively using services like GitHub Dependabot or similar tools (e.g., Renovate Bot) not only allows us to receive real-time alerts about known vulnerabilities but also to automatically generate Pull Requests for their remediation. While these tools focus on known vulnerabilities, they free up resources for deeper investigations into potential zero-day threats.
- 🔁 **Incorporating regular dependency updates** into the CI/CD workflow to ensure packages remain current and potential fixes are applied promptly.
- 🔎 **Regular code security audits and penetration testing**. Conducting periodic code audits and penetration tests (pentests) by third-party experts or an internal team can uncover logical flaws or obscure vulnerabilities that could be leveraged as zero-days before malicious actors discover them.
- 🧑‍💻 **Enhancing team security awareness**: regular training for developers on secure coding best practices, along with staying informed about the latest trends in cybersecurity, helps foster a "security by default" culture.

While zero-day risks can never be fully eliminated, **our layered, proactive approach significantly strengthens the project's resilience and its ability to respond to novel and emerging threats**.

### 2.4 Conclusion

The `music_app` frontend currently **meets modern security best practices** for dependency management and supply chain hygiene:

- ✅ No known **critical or high-severity vulnerabilities** were found during the audit.
- ✅ The project maintains a **clean and minimal dependency tree**, reducing the overall attack surface.

## 3. Proposal for Package Replacement: `axios`

### 3.1 Package to be Replaced

- **Current**: `axios`
- **Proposed Alternative**: Native `fetch` API (built into modern browsers)

### 3.2 Rationale for Replacement

Replacing `axios` with the native `fetch` API aligns with the project's security and performance goals by:

- 🔐 **Reducing the total number of third-party dependencies**, which minimizes the project's attack surface.
- 📦 **Decreasing bundle size**, as `fetch` is built into all modern browsers and adds no runtime weight.
- 🔄 **Delegating maintenance and security** responsibilities to browser vendors, who patch vulnerabilities directly.

### 3.3 Security Assessment of `fetch`

| Aspect                     | `axios`                                      | Native `fetch` API                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Security Source**        | Maintained by a third-party open-source team | Built into browsers (Google, Mozilla, etc.) |
| **Vulnerability Handling** | Via npm updates and audits                   | Patched automatically via browser updates   |
| **Dependencies**           | Includes a small dependency tree             | None                                        |
| **Attack Surface**         | External library + transitive dependencies   | No additional surface                       |

### 3.4 Feature Comparison

| Feature            | `axios`                                 | Native `fetch` API                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Ease of Use**    | Built-in JSON parsing and status checks | Requires manual `response.ok` & `json()`    |
| **Error Handling** | Automatically throws on HTTP errors     | Requires manual conditionals                |
| **Bundle Size**    | Adds ~15–30 KB                          | 0 KB (native)                               |
| **Support**        | Large community                         | Native support, broad browser documentation |

### 3.5 Conclusion

While `axios` remains a reliable and widely used HTTP client, it introduces additional dependencies and maintenance overhead. The native `fetch` API is a more secure and performant alternative for most use cases in the `music_app` frontend.

> ✅ **Recommendation**: Proceed with migrating from `axios` to `fetch`, with utility wrappers if needed to streamline error handling and response parsing.
